/**
 * Theoretical Questions for JavaScript Exercises
 *
 * Below are theoretical questions corresponding to each exercise topic covered so far.
 * Reflect on and answer these to deepen your understanding before coding.
 */

/* 1. Variables & Data Types */
// Q1. What is a variable in JavaScript, and how do you declare one?
// Q2. Explain the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`. When would you use each?
// Q3. List the seven primitive data types in JS. How does `typeof` work?

/* 2. Operators & Expressions */
// Q1. What is the difference between the assignment operator `=` and the equality operators `==` and `===`?
// Q2. How do arithmetic, comparison, logical, and ternary operators work? Give an example of each.
// Q3. What does operator precedence mean, and how can you change it?

/* 3. Control Flow (if/else, switch) */
// Q1. How does an `if...else` statement control program flow? When would you choose `switch` instead?
// Q2. What types of values are considered “truthy” or “falsy” in JS?
// Q3. Describe the fall-through behavior in a `switch` statement. How do you prevent it?

/* 4. Loops (for, while) */
// Q1. Compare `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. When might you use each?
// Q2. What is an infinite loop, and how can it occur?
// Q3. How can you prematurely exit a loop or skip an iteration?

/* 5. Functions */
// Q1. What’s the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
// Q2. Explain the concepts of parameters vs. arguments.
// Q3. What is a callback function? Provide a scenario where it’s useful.

/* 6. Arrays */
// Q1. How do you create an array, and how can you access or modify its elements?
// Q2. Describe at least five common array methods (`push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `map`, `filter`, etc.).
// Q3. How does `Array.prototype.reduce` work? Give an example use case.

/* 7. Objects & Properties */
// Q1. What is an object in JS, and how is it different from an array?
// Q2. How do dot notation and bracket notation differ for accessing properties?
// Q3. Explain prototypal inheritance. How do you add methods shared by all instances?

/* 8. ES6+ Features */
// Q1. What are template literals, and how do they improve string concatenation?
// Q2. How do arrow functions differ from regular functions regarding `this` and `arguments`?
// Q3. Explain destructuring assignment for objects and arrays with examples.

/* 9. DOM Manipulation */
// Q1. What is the DOM, and how does JS interact with it?
// Q2. How do `document.getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll` differ?
// Q3. What are the pros and cons of modifying innerHTML vs. creating/appending elements?

/* 10. Event Handling */
// Q1. How does event propagation (bubbling vs. capturing) work?
// Q2. What is `event.preventDefault()` and when would you use it?
// Q3. How can you remove an event listener once it’s no longer needed?

/* 11. Asynchronous JavaScript */
// Q1. Describe the JavaScript event loop and call stack.
// Q2. What are callbacks, Promises, and `async`/`await`? How do they relate?
// Q3. How do you handle errors in promises vs. async functions?
